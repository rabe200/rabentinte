# DISCLAIMER: this name was chosen before chosing to become a fish and therefore going to swim in the tank of jobs

I am just a raven exploring the outer worlds of the internet. "Das Internet ist Neuland f√ºr uns.", a very famous german person once said and i cringed hard. If you are looking for devastating artworks combined with coding look no further. This fish that is actually a raven is disguising you in this selfdescription.  

## Goals
- become a code monkey
- be part of the circus
- document circus
- learn to escape the circus
- change the circus
- educate other monkeys
- write a book called **AI: no escape (and monkeys)**
